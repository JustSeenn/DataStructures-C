# DataStructures-C

Welcome to our C data structures repository! We have created a collection of files containing simple, efficient, and optimized implementations of various common data structures.

## Why use our data structures?

- Our implementations are designed to be easy to use and integrate into your C projects.
- We have carefully optimized them for maximum performance.
- We have added comments in the code to help you understand how each data structure works.

## How to use our data structures?

- Download the repository to your computer by clicking the "Clone or download" button.
- Unzip the downloaded archive and open the folder in your preferred code editor.
- Each file contains a different data structure, with its name as a suffix (e.g., "linked_list.c" contains an implementation of a linked list).
- To use a data structure in your project, simply include the corresponding file in your source code and follow the instructions in the comments.

## What types of data structures are included?

Here is the list of data structures you will find in our repository:

- Linked list
- Binary search tree
- HashMap

And many more! We continue to add new data structures to our repository, so be sure to check back regularly for updates.
Thank you for choosing our data structures!
